# TicTacToe - Game Tree

The project is based on the mapping of the possibilities of plays through the graph and use of this information for the bot to choose their moves.

The application was written in Python 3, and it appeared like academic work for the discipline of algorithms and data structure.

## System Functionalities and Modules

* TicTacToe
  - Player vs Player
  - Player vs Computer
  - Computer vs Player
  - Computer vs Computer
  - Generate game tree with all possibilities
* Graph
  - Add vertice
  - Add edge
  - Rem vertice
  - Rem edge
  - Check if they are connected
  - Return vertex entry degree
  - Return vertex output degree
  - Return adjacent vertices
  - Return Minor Edges
  - Return larger edges
  - Search width
  - Deep search
  - Return all edges sorted by heapsort
  - Return minimal tree generator by Kruskal
  - Return minimum generating tree by Prim
  - Return smaller distance from one vertex to all others by Dijkstra
* Data Persistence
  - Import graph
  - Export graph
